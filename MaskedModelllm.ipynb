    "#### Masking different Parts of Speech in the Training dataset\n",
    "The primary approach to train the BiLSTM model is to ***mimic the human interpretation of filling in a blank word in a sentence by training the model to analyze the positioning of different parts of speech in sentences individually so as to analyze which part of speech to use in what form most aptly in given unseen data where a masked word is to be predicted***. For this purpose, firstly primary parts of speech- including nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives and determiners are masked in sentences by dividing the dataset into 5 groups of 10,000 sentences and masking one given POS as per the order mentioned in the list(The order has been improved by hit and trial by interchanging positions of different POS to gain maximum usage of the training data). In case a given sentence does not have the designated POS, fallback POS categories have been defined in specific order of priority, which will be masked in case the main POS categories are not present in the sentence thereby ensuring maximum usage of the training data. The compiled masked sentences are stored finally in a numpy array x_train along with the actual masked words in y_train"

    "#### Bidirectional LSTM model to predict the masked words in sentences\n",
    "A bidirectional LSTM model has been utilized to analyze the context of different words masked in the training data with reference to the different parts of speech and make prediction as close as possible to the actual masked word. ***The prediction is a raw 300D embedding made by using two BiLSTM layers with units 256 and 128 respectively(fine tuned as per the model's performance) and based on a combined loss evaluation metric. The combined loss is the mean squared error loss(mse) and cosine similarity loss( custom functioned designed to return 1-cosine similarity, closer the loss to 0, higher the cosine similarity). This is done, firstly to reduce absolute distance from the actual word embedding and also considering the fact that synonymous words may differ in magintude as vectors but are oriented in the same direction as meaured by cosine similarity, thus predicting actual close embedding but also taking into account the synonymous context.***"
